							<p>The Schools Division Office (SDO) of Batanes was established on june 1914 with Mr. Mauricio Lazo as the first Head Teacher. The Division office was housed at the second floor of the what was then Casa Real ( now Provincial Capitol Building ) in Basco. In 1976, the office was transferred to its present location along Cavangan Drive with the construction of one "Bagong Lipunan" building thru help of Hon. Jose L. Santana, Mayor of Basco from 1968-1978 and a former Academic Supervisior & OIC Superintendent from 1952-1958 and under the leadership of Mrs. Lolita B. Galita who served as Schools Division Superintendent from 1977-1981. In 2004, the Schools Division Office was rehabilitated with additional structures through the Third Elementary Education Program (TEEP) of the national government, and under the leadership of Corazon T. Barrientos, EdD, CESO V, Schools Division Superintendent from 2005-2007. The rehabilitated buildings were inaugrated on September 10, 2005 by Hon.
